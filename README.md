##Summary:
This project is an app for predicting the winner of an ongoing URF (or less accurately, normal) match in real-time.
At the core of the project is a Machine Learning model built using Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree for predicting if the player will win or lose her current match. The project also contains a demo web app to demonstrate how the scoring is done in real time.

##Demo:
The demo web app can be found here: http://lolapichallengepredict.appspot.com/
