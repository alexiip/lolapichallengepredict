Summary
The project is an app for predicting the winner of the ongoing URF (or less accurately, normal) match in real-time.
At the core of the project is a Machine Learning model built using Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree for predicting if the player will win her current URF (or less accurately normal) match in real time. The project also contains a demo web app to demonstrate how the scoring is done in real time.

Demo
